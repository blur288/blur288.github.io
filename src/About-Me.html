        I am from the Bay Area in California, I enjoy computers and have been programming since I was 14. The reason I started programming originally was because I wanted to try game
        hacking. It wasn't easy but after a few months I had gotten down the basics of c++. I much more prefer low level languages programming because of the amount of control you get.
        Even before running the program you are able to know exactly how everything will look in memory.
